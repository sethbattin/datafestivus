<h1>WebRTC for the Rest of Us</h1>
<p>Because Mozilla and Google seem to think everyone wants to build their own video chat app.  But the rest of us don't care about that.</p>
</header>
<div id="main">
    <p>This app will establish a connection with another browser via WebRTC (Real-Time Communication) API.  It will not use this connection for video chat.  It might create a text chat.  But the important part is passing arbitrary data (that isn't immediately sent to a video output).</p>
    <p>This process requires a few steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Accept that WebRTC absolutely, 100% <strong>WILL</strong> require a server in order to establish a connection.  Accepting is the first step in healing.  Glossing over this fact is stupid.  But it's not as stupid as establishing a connection to yourself in the same browser, which is what most WebRTC tutorials do.</li>
        <li>Anything can serve as that server.  You don't need App Engine, Firebase, Node/Mongo, or any other goofy aparatus.  You need a webserver with one page and one data store.  You could probably use FTP, or even CPanel.  You might be able to make a Wordpress custom field do the job, if you were desperate enough.</li>
        <li>That server only needs to stash a bit of JSON at a sharable URL.  Then it stores another bit of JSON, and then its job is done.  Hosting-R-Us's crappiest service can support this process, because it doesn't need to persist.  The busy communication is between browsers directly (that's the whole point).</li>
    </ol>

    var connection = new ConnectionModel('abcd');
    var offerer = connection.init('offeringplayer');
    var answerer = connection.respond('answeringplayer');
